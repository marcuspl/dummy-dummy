<h2>Howdy sweet customer</h2>

Here is the data I wanted you to pay me for:
<p/>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Data (a relatively unique random string)</th>
      <th>Payment</th>
      <th>Date</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>

    <td>

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

This data will be reloaded dynamically every now and then so that you get new random strings.
