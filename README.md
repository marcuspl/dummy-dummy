# Product-dummy-dummy
Example of a no-design, no-backend dummy prototype
> Dummy noun, plural dummies.
> 1. a representation or copy of something, as for displaying to indicate appearance

This project is used to show the idea prototyping products using a subset of plain ol' html. A lot of the work of developing a product can be done without fancy design or advanced backend stuff. A few examples of such work, where a dummy-prototype like this can used, include:
   * Develop site-map or the structure of the app
   * Develop content
     * get the first ideas of static copy down
     * put out placeholders for images and infographics
     * hard code examples of dynamic data
   * Develop specifications
      * User stories
      * examples of dynamic data
      * other specifications

These are but a few examples of the purposes of a dummy-prototype. Although it is simple and stupid, it already serves as excellent input for the graphics designer (make it pretty) and the programmer (make it smart).

*It also allows the non-technical development to make actual progress and not have to get stuck in frustration.*

If non-technical aspiring entrepreneurs could get get used to working with github, it is useful in many ways:
  * Paired with [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) it serves as a free host for the web site of your company and/or product. [As it does for this one.](https://marcuspl.github.io/product-dummy-dummy/)
  * It allows you to do content management, saving time and money being able to add or update content without having to go through project managers or programmers. This is done by simply editing a file directly in the github user interface.
  * It allows you to invite external contractors into *your* project. This is important because:
    * It allwos you to maintain ownership of the project.
    * It saves time and money for others to have to setup and hand over the project themselves.
    * It gives you an ideal location to collect user stories, requirement, content and such.
    * It allows you to follow the work of the technical team on their own turf, allowing for better project management and less boilerplate. 
    * It greatly mitigates the risk of a project being dropped between the originators and the technical team once the technical project is done. (Very common.)
