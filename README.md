# dummy-dummy
Example of a no-design, no-backend dummy prototype
> Dummy noun, plural dummies.
> 1. a representation or copy of something, as for displaying to indicate appearance

This project is used to show the idea prototyping products using a subset of plain ol' html. A lot of the work of developing a product can be done without fancy design or advanced backend stuff. A few examples of such work, where a dummy-prototype like this can used, include:
   * Develop site-map or the structure of the app
   * Develop content
     * get the first ideas of static copy down
     * put out placeholders for images and infographics
     * hard code examples of dynamic data
   * Develop specifications
      * User stories
      * examples of dynamic data
      * other specifications

These are but a few examples of the purposes of a dummy-prototype but serves as excellent input for the graphics designer (make it pretty) and the programmer (make it smart).

It also allows the non-technical development to make actual progress and not have to get stuck in frustration.
